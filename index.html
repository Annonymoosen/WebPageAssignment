    <p> Hello. I am a college student. I work in gaining skills in the arts. I am a part time artist. I have worked on making art for over a decade now. </p> 
    
<p> I work with both digital and phyiscal artwork. I normally use a pencil and paper, however, I have an interest and experince working with digital art. Every day brings a new chance to refine my art and improve. I believe in the idea of "work hard, play hard." It is how I deal with my challenging workload, but it is all worth it in the end. </p>

<p> I hope to help inject some creativity in the world again. I love to see people get inspired and want to make new art. I hope I may be able to inspire some people with my art. <br> I try to practice in areas of art where I fall short. I fall short in making digital artwork. </p>
<p> When I am not working on assignments, I like to draw. I try to improve <em> my art </em> by trying to draw something new each day. When I am not doing that, I hang out with my friends. We play games and watch movies together. It is a very <strong> fun </strong> time!</p>
